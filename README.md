# heroku-buildpack-metrics

This buildpack sets up the necessary machinery to
utilize
[Heroku's Language Metrics](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/language-runtime-metrics) feature,
which currently supports the JVM only.

## How does it affect my slug?

This buildpack does two things.

1. Copies a jar into the slug
2. Copies a [.profile.d/](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos#the-profile-file) script into your slug

The jar file, when `$HEROKU_METRICS_URL` is set as a result of the
`runtime-heroku-metrics` labs flag, will be used as an agent to your
Java process. This jar exposes metrics via
a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) server which an additional
process, namely [agentmon](https://github.com/heroku/agentmon), will
poll and forward to `$HEROKU_METRICS_URL`, for processing.

The [.profile.d/](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos#the-profile-file) script downloads the latest agentmon release, and
starts it on Dyno boot.

## Releasing

If you belong to the Heroku org, you can release a new version of the buildpack
by running the following command:

```
$ git reset --hard origin/master
$ heroku buildkits:publish heroku/metrics
```

This will publish whatever is in the repo (including dirty changes), which is why
we suggest running `git reset` first.

## Testing

This buildpack uses [Hatchet](https://github.com/heroku/hatchet) to run integration tests. To run them local
make sure you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) installed, then execute:

```sh-session
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rspec spec/
```
